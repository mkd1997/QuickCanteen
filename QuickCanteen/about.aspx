        The system is a Canteen Automation System that is designed for students and canteen owners 
        and can be used to streamline the process of ordering and serving food at canteens. 
        Unlike the manual ordering system used at most canteens, using this system will minimize 
        the long queues of students at the canteen and will hence reduce the chaos in the canteen. 
        The system is designed to allow student to make payment via online payment methods thus 
        making exchange of cash easier. The system makes it easier for canteen owners to get feedback 
        from students about the food served and service of the canteen.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  

        In today’s fast paced world, where students do not have time for waiting in queues in the overcrowded canteens. Canteen managers have little time to ask for feedback on their food from students alongside managing the chaos in the canteen, QuickCanteen is a canteen automation
 Web Application that connects students and the canteen managers. Unlike the current manual ordering system, it allows students to view the menu of any canteen and order food at anytime, anywhere and allows students to pay via online wallets which further ads to the convenience of both the parties. Once the basic prototype gets launched successfully, the application will be extended to provide the students with the facility to order food days in advance and also specify the time they need it prepared.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

        QuickCanteen connects the canteen managers and students by allowing students to order food from the canteens and allowing canteen managers to get feedback from students. It supports payment via e-wallets thus reducing chaos in the canteen during rush hours.
